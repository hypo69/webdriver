## Overview

The `background.js` script is a background script in a browser extension. It runs in the background and does not require a user interface. This script is often used to handle installation events and manage extension-wide functionality.

## Event Listener

### `chrome.runtime.onInstalled.addListener`

```javascript
chrome.runtime.onInstalled.addListener(() => {
    console.log('OpenAI Model Interface Extension Installed');
});
```

**Description**: This event listener is triggered when the extension is first installed or updated.

**Functionality**:

-   It logs a message `OpenAI Model Interface Extension Installed` to the console.

This simple script serves as a basic example of how to listen for the installation event within a browser extension, and provides a way to confirm proper setup.
