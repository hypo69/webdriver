## Overview

This script is a small, self-contained piece of JavaScript that is intended to be executed in a browser environment. It focuses on directly manipulating the appearance of a web page and showing a simple alert dialog. This type of script is often used for quick modifications, debugging purposes, or as a minimal example in a larger context.

## Code Snippet

```javascript
document.body.style.border = "5px solid red";
alert()
```

### Description

This script consists of two lines of JavaScript code:

-   `document.body.style.border = "5px solid red";`
-  `alert()`

### Functionality

-   **`document.body.style.border = "5px solid red";`**: This line directly modifies the style of the `<body>` element in the HTML document. It sets the `border` property to `5px solid red`, which adds a red border around the visible content of the page.

-   **`alert()`**: This line triggers a simple alert dialog with no message. The alert is expected to be rendered by the browser as soon as the script is executed.

This code snippet provides a clear and basic way to modify the style of a page and show a popup dialog, which can be useful for debugging purposes.
