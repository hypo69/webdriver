## Overview

The `popup.html` file defines the user interface for a test popup within a Firefox extension. It is intended for debugging purposes with a `MODE` variable. It includes a basic heading and paragraph to display a short message about the extension's purpose.

## HTML Structure

The HTML structure consists of the following parts:

### Head

-   A `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration to define the document type.
-   An `<html>` tag with a `lang="en"` attribute, specifying the language.
-   A `<head>` tag containing:
    -  A `<meta charset="UTF-8">` tag to specify the character encoding.
    - A `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">` tag for responsive behavior.
    -   A `<title>` tag with the text "Hypotez".

### Body

-   A `<body>` tag containing:
    -   An `<h1>` tag with the text "Hypotez".
    -  A `<p>` tag with the text "Привет, Это Давидка. Я обучаю модель", which translates to "Hello, this is Davidka. I'm training the model.".

This simple HTML structure provides a basic message to the user of the extension.
