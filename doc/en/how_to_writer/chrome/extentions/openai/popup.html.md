How to use this code block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This `popup.html` file defines the structure and basic user interface for a popup within a Chrome extension named "OpenAI Model Interface". It includes interactive elements for users to interact with an OpenAI model, such as a chat interface, and controls for managing or training the model. The page is built using HTML, AngularJS, and includes external scripts and CSS for styling and logic.

Execution steps
-------------------------
1.  **Set up the HTML structure**: The `popup.html` file sets up the structure of the extension's popup with:
    -   A `DOCTYPE html` declaration indicating it is an HTML5 document.
    -   An `html` tag, the root element of the page.
    -   A `head` section that includes:
        -   The page title "OpenAI Model Interface".
        -   Links to the AngularJS library (`angular.min.js`) and jQuery library (`jquery-3.5.1.slim.min.js`).
        -  A link to `popup.js`, which contains JavaScript logic for the popup.
        -  A link to `style.css` for styling the popup.
    -   A `body` section with AngularJS application `openaiApp` and controller `MainController`, that handles the UI and interactions:
        -   A heading `h1` with the text "OpenAI Model Interface".
        -   A navigation bar using a `ul` with the class `tabs` containing two `li` elements representing the "Chat" and "Model" tabs.
        -   A `div` with `ng-show` directive to display content for "Chat" tab and includes:
            -  A label and select dropdown list for assistants using the `select` tag.
            - A `textarea` tag for user input and a button that invokes the `sendMessage()` method.
            -  A `div` tag with id `response` that is used to display responses.
         - A second `div` tag with `ng-show` directive to display content for "Model" tab and includes:
            -  Paragraphs with instructions.
            -  A `textarea` for training data and a button that invokes `trainModel()` method.
            - A paragraph to display training status.
2.  **AngularJS Integration**: AngularJS is used to manage the UI dynamically:
    -   The `ng-app="openaiApp"` directive bootstraps the AngularJS application within the `body` tag.
    -   The `ng-controller="MainController"` directive defines the controller for this section of the application.
    -   `ng-show` directive makes parts of the page conditionally visible.
    -   `ng-model` binds HTML elements to the AngularJS scope for data management.
    -  `ng-click` directives bind user actions to functions defined in the AngularJS controller
    - `ng-options` used for the `select` element.
3. **Use with JavaScript and CSS**: The `popup.js` (not provided here) is a JavaScript file that will contain the logic for AngularJS application, it is referenced from within the `head` of the file, same as for `style.css` file for styling the popup window.
4.  **Integrate with Chrome Extension**: This HTML file is intended to be used as the popup of a Chrome extension. The extension's manifest file should specify this file as the default popup.
