How to use this code block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This JavaScript code is designed to be a part of a Chrome extension's background script. It sets up an event listener that triggers when the extension is installed or updated. This script provides an initial setup action by logging a message to the console.

Execution steps
-------------------------
1.  **Set up the installation listener**: The code uses `chrome.runtime.onInstalled.addListener(() => { ... });` to set up an event listener that is triggered when the extension is first installed, updated, or when Chrome itself is updated.
2.  **Log an installation message**: Inside the listener, `console.log('OpenAI Model Interface Extension Installed');` sends a message to the browser's console, indicating that the extension has been installed or updated successfully. This is useful for confirming the correct installation of the extension and can aid in debugging.

Usage example
-------------------------
```javascript
// background.js

chrome.runtime.onInstalled.addListener(() => {
    console.log('OpenAI Model Interface Extension Installed');
});
```
```
