How to use this code block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code block contains the minified source code for AngularJS version 1.8.2. It is a comprehensive JavaScript framework that provides a wide range of features for building dynamic web applications. Due to the nature of minified code, understanding the logic and actions directly from the code block is challenging without further unminifying it. However, we can describe what AngularJS generally does and how this code is typically used within a project.

Execution steps
-------------------------
This is a minified library, not an application code block. Therefore, there are no direct execution steps. Instead, here's how you use it:

1. **Include in HTML**: To use AngularJS in your project, you need to include this code in your HTML file. Typically, this is done by adding a `<script>` tag in the `<head>` or before the closing `</body>` tag.
   - Example:
   
2. **Bootstrap AngularJS**: After including the library, you bootstrap the AngularJS application by adding the `ng-app` directive in one of your HTML elements, typically in the `html` or `body` tag.
   - Example:
    
3. **Create AngularJS Modules**: Create AngularJS modules to organize your application's components (services, directives, controllers, etc.). Modules are created using the `angular.module` function.
   - Example:
    ```javascript
     angular.module('myApp', []);
     ```
4. **Define Components**: Define different types of components such as:
   - **Controllers**: To add application logic to HTML templates.
     - Example:
     ```javascript
       angular.module('myApp').controller('myController', function($scope) {
           $scope.message = 'Hello from Angular';
       });
     ```
   - **Directives**: To enhance or modify the behaviour of HTML elements.
     - Example:
      ```javascript
      angular.module('myApp').directive('myDirective', function() {
          return {
            template: '<div>{{message}}</div>'
          };
       });
     ```
   - **Services**: To provide reusable functionalities.
     - Example:
       ```javascript
       angular.module('myApp').service('myService', function() {
           this.getData = function() { return "Data from service" };
       });
     ```
5.  **Use Directives and Controllers in HTML**: Use directives and controllers in HTML to create dynamic UI elements.
   - Example:
   
6. **Interact with AngularJS**: Use various AngularJS features like:
  - Data binding:  To keep the UI and model in sync using expressions like `{{variableName}}` or directives like `ng-model`.
  - Dependency Injection: To manage and inject services in different modules and components.
  - Services: To create reusable business logic.
  - Directives: To create reusable UI components and to enhance functionality of HTML elements.
