How to use this code block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This `popup.html` file is the HTML structure for a popup in a Chrome extension, it is designed to send the current tab's URL to the background script. The popup consists of a button that triggers an action when clicked. The associated JavaScript for this popup is found in `popup.js` (not included here, and should be in the same directory).

Execution steps
-------------------------
1.  **Set up the HTML structure**: The `popup.html` file creates the basic structure for the extension's popup which consists of:
    -   A `DOCTYPE html` declaration, specifying the document type as HTML5.
    -   A `html` tag, the root element of the document.
    -   A `head` section which includes the document title, and a reference to `popup.js` script, which is the JavaScript file for the logic.
    -   A `body` section which includes a single `button` element with the id `sendUrlButton`, which contains text `Send URL`.
2.  **Use with popup.js**: The `popup.js` file (not included here) is the JavaScript code that will perform the action when the button with `id="sendUrlButton"` is clicked. It will most likely send a message to a background script to perform an action with the URL of the current tab.
3.  **Integrate with Chrome Extension**: This HTML file is intended to be used as the popup page of a Chrome extension. The extension's manifest file will typically specify this file as the default popup.

Usage example
-------------------------


**Note**: The `popup.js` file is necessary to provide functionality to this HTML file, as it will be the file that handles interaction when the button is clicked, however, it's not included in the provided code.
