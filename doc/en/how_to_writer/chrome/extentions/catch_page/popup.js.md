How to use this code block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This JavaScript code is designed to be used as a popup script for a Chrome extension. It adds an event listener to a button, which, upon being clicked, retrieves the URL of the current active tab and sends it to a background script. The script also handles the response from the background script, providing alerts to the user based on the response status.

Execution steps
-------------------------
1. **Set up a click event listener**: The `document.getElementById("sendUrlButton").addEventListener("click", () => { ... });` line adds a click event listener to the HTML element with the ID `"sendUrlButton"`. This listener is executed when the button is clicked.
2.  **Alert the user (debug)**: Inside the click event listener, `alert("Hello, world!");` displays a simple message to the user (intended for debugging and it's not needed for actual functionality).
3. **Get the active tab**: `chrome.tabs.query({ active: true, currentWindow: true }, (tabs) => { ... });` queries the Chrome API to get information about the currently active tab in the current window.
4.  **Extract URL**: Inside the query callback function, the URL of the active tab is extracted from `tabs[0].url` and stored in the `activeTabUrl` variable.
5. **Send message to the background script**:  `chrome.runtime.sendMessage({ action: "sendUrl", url: activeTabUrl }, (response) => { ... });` sends a message containing the `action` as `"sendUrl"` and the `activeTabUrl` to the background script of the extension. The `sendResponse` callback function is used to handle the response.
6.  **Handle the response**: The callback function from the `sendMessage` call handles the response from the background script.
    -   If `response.status` is `"success"`, it displays an alert to the user: "URL sent successfully!".
    -   If the `response.status` is not `"success"`, it displays an alert: "Failed to send URL."

Usage example
-------------------------
```javascript
// popup.js
document.getElementById("sendUrlButton").addEventListener("click", () => {
    alert("Hello, world!");
    chrome.tabs.query({ active: true, currentWindow: true }, (tabs) => {
        let activeTab = tabs[0];
        let activeTabUrl = activeTab.url;
        
        chrome.runtime.sendMessage({ action: "sendUrl", url: activeTabUrl }, (response) => {
            if (response.status === "success") {
                alert("URL sent successfully!");
            } else {
                alert("Failed to send URL.");
            }
        });
    });
});
```
```
