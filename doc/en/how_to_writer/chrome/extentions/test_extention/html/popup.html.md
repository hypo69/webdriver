How to use this code block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This `popup.html` file provides the basic HTML structure for a popup within a Chrome extension called "hypotez". The popup provides a simple interface that displays a title ("hypotez") and a brief message explaining how to use the extension. It's a static page with minimal content, intended as a starting point for a basic extension UI.

Execution steps
-------------------------
1.  **Set up the basic HTML structure**: The `popup.html` file creates the basic structure of the extension's popup, including:
    -   A `DOCTYPE html` declaration, specifying the document type as HTML5.
    -   An `html` tag, the root element of the document.
    -   A `head` section containing:
        -   A `title` tag setting the title of the page to "hypotez".
        -   A `style` tag defining minimal CSS to control the size and padding of the body.
    -   A `body` section containing:
        -  A heading (`h1`) with the text "hypotez".
        -   A paragraph (`p`) that provides a brief usage instruction, telling the user to click the extension's icon to collect data.
2.  **Include as extension popup**: This HTML file is intended to be used as a popup within a Chrome extension, which can be specified in the extension's manifest file.
3.  **Add functionality**: For any interactive or dynamic functionality, you will need to create a separate JavaScript file, and link it to the HTML file via `<script>` tag in `<head>`. This is not shown here.

Usage example
-------------------------
This HTML file provides a static user interface, and cannot be directly executed in the browser.
