How to use this code block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This JavaScript code snippet is designed to be injected into a webpage, typically through a browser extension's content script. Its primary purpose is to modify the visual appearance of the webpage by adding a red border around the body element and displaying an alert message.

Execution steps
-------------------------
1. **Set the border style**: The `document.body.style.border = "5px solid red";` line targets the `body` element of the current web page and sets its border style to a 5-pixel solid red line.
2.  **Display alert message**: The `alert()` function call will display a default browser alert window with empty text.

Usage example
-------------------------
```javascript
// content.js or injected script

document.body.style.border = "5px solid red";
alert()
```
```
