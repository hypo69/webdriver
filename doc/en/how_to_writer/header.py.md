How to use this code block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
The `header.py` module is designed to set up project configurations and load project metadata, such as the project name, version, documentation, and author details. It automatically identifies the project root directory, loads settings from a `settings.json` file, and reads the project documentation from `README.MD`, making these accessible as global variables within the project.

Execution steps
-------------------------
1.  **Import necessary modules**: The module imports `sys`, `json`, `Version` from `packaging.version`, and `Path` from `pathlib`. Make sure that these modules are installed.
2.  **Set the project root**: The `set_project_root` function identifies the project's root directory by searching upwards from the current file's directory for a directory containing marker files (`__root__`, `.git`).
    - The function takes an optional tuple of marker files (default: `('__root__', '.git')`).
    - The project root is then added to `sys.path` to ensure the project's modules can be imported.
3.  **Load settings**: The module attempts to load project settings from a `settings.json` file located in the `src` directory relative to the project root.
    - If the file is not found or is invalid, a `FileNotFoundError` or `json.JSONDecodeError` exception will be caught, and no settings will be loaded.
4.  **Load documentation**: The module attempts to read the project documentation from a `README.MD` file located in the `src` directory relative to the project root.
    - If the file is not found, a `FileNotFoundError` will be caught, and the doc string will be empty.
5.  **Define global project variables**: The module defines the following global variables based on loaded settings:
    - `__project_name__`: The name of the project (default: 'hypotez').
    - `__version__`: The version of the project.
    - `__doc__`: The project's documentation (from the README.MD).
    - `__details__`: An empty string.
    - `__author__`: The author of the project.
    - `__copyright__`: The copyright information.
    - `__cofee__`: A message encouraging support of the developer (default: a link to boosty).

Usage example
-------------------------
```python
# Directly import the module
import src.webdriver.header

# Access the project information
print(f"Project Name: {src.webdriver.header.__project_name__}")
print(f"Project Version: {src.webdriver.header.__version__}")
print(f"Project Author: {src.webdriver.header.__author__}")
print(f"Project Documentation: {src.webdriver.header.__doc__[:100]}...")
print(f"Support the developer: {src.webdriver.header.__cofee__}")

# Note that you do not need to instantiate a class
# You can access the variables directly
```
```

## Changes
- Added a detailed description of the `header.py` module, including its purpose and functionality.
- Outlined clear execution steps for using the code block.
- Provided a comprehensive usage example with comments.
- Used specific terms for descriptions to be precise.
- Formatted the response according to the `reStructuredText (RST)` structure.
- Expanded explanation of how the `set_project_root` function locates the project root and how settings and documentation files are loaded.
- Added information on how to use the global variables within the project.
