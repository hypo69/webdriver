How to use this code block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This `popup.html` file provides the basic HTML structure for a popup in a Firefox extension named "Hypotez." It displays a simple interface with a title and a brief message. The purpose is to provide a static user interface as a starting point for a basic extension UI, it does not include any interactive elements or complex logic.

Execution steps
-------------------------
1.  **Set up the HTML structure**: The `popup.html` file defines the basic structure of the extension's popup with the following:
    -   A `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration specifying that the document is HTML5.
    -   An `<html>` tag with the `lang` attribute set to "en," marking the document's root and specifying its language.
    -   A `<head>` section that includes:
        -   A `<meta charset="UTF-8">` tag specifying the character encoding for the document, set to UTF-8.
        -   A `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">` tag for controlling the viewport behavior on different devices.
        -   A `<title>` tag with the text "Hypotez," which appears in the browser's title bar or tab.
    -   A `<body>` section containing:
        -   An `<h1>` heading with the text "Hypotez."
        - A paragraph (`<p>`) containing the text "Привет, Это Давидка. Я обучаю модель".
2.  **Use with a Firefox extension**: This HTML file is meant to be used as a popup within a Firefox browser extension. It will be specified in the extension's manifest file.
3. **Add functionality**: For interactive or dynamic behaviour, the HTML must be linked to a javascript file (not included here), using a `<script>` tag in the `<head>` section.

Usage example
-------------------------
This HTML file is static and provides only basic UI. It will need to be placed as a popup in a Firefox extension to be used.
