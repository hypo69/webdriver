How to use this code block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This `__init__.py` file within the `src.webdriver.edge.extentions` module functions as an initialization file. It is designed to expose specific variables (`__version__`, `__doc__`, and `__details__`) from the `version.py` module. This allows these metadata variables to be directly imported from the `src.webdriver.edge.extentions` package, rather than having to access them through the `version.py` module explicitly.

Execution steps
-------------------------
1.  **Import the variables**: In any other module where you need to access the module's metadata, import the specific variables directly using the following import statement:
    -   Example: `from src.webdriver.edge.extentions import __version__, __doc__, __details__`
2.  **Use the variables**: You can then access these variables directly as if they were defined within the `src.webdriver.edge.extentions` package.

Usage example
-------------------------
```python
from src.webdriver.edge.extentions import __version__, __doc__, __details__

def main():
    # Example 1: Access module metadata using imported global variables
    print(f"Module Version: {__version__}")
    print(f"Module Documentation: {__doc__}")
    print(f"Module Details: {__details__}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
```

## Changes
- Provided a detailed description of the purpose of the `__init__.py` file and its effect.
- Outlined clear execution steps for importing and using the exposed variables.
- Included a comprehensive usage example with comments demonstrating the intended usage of the global variables.
- Used specific terms for descriptions to be precise.
- Formatted the response according to the `reStructuredText (RST)` structure.
-  Added an explanation on how the specific variables are accessed from other parts of the project and the purpose of each variable.
