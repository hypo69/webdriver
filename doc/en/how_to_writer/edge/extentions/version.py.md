How to use this code block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
The `version.py` module is designed to store and provide metadata about the `src.webdriver.edge.extentions` module. This metadata includes the version number, module name, documentation string, additional details, type annotations, and author information. These variables can be accessed from other parts of the project to provide information about the module for logging, debugging, and display purposes.

Execution steps
-------------------------
1.  **Import the module**: In other modules where you need to access the version information, import the `version.py` module.
    -   Example:  `from src.webdriver.edge.extentions import version` or `import src.webdriver.edge.extentions.version`.
2.  **Access the global variables**: You can access the metadata through these global variables:
    -   `version.__version__`: Provides the version of this module, as a string.
    -   `version.__name__`: Provides the name of this module, as a string.
    -   `version.__doc__`: Provides the module's documentation, as a string.
    -   `version.__details__`: Provides additional details, as a string.
    -   `version.__annotations__`: Contains type annotations for variables and functions as a dictionary.
    -   `version.__author__`: The name of the author of the module, as a string.
3. **Utilize in your project**: These global variables can then be used throughout your project for version tracking, debugging, or other purposes as needed. This module contains no executable code other than the declaration of global variables.

Usage example
-------------------------
```python
from src.webdriver.edge.extentions import version

def main():
    # Example 1: Display module metadata
    print(f"Module Name: {version.__name__}")
    print(f"Module Version: {version.__version__}")
    print(f"Module Documentation: {version.__doc__}")
    print(f"Module Details: {version.__details__}")
    print(f"Module Author: {version.__author__}")
    print(f"Module Annotations: {version.__annotations__}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
```
