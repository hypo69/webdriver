How to use this code block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This `popup.html` file provides the basic structure for a popup in a Chrome extension named "hypotez". It displays a simple interface with a title and a message, designed to instruct the user on how to interact with the extension. It's a static HTML page intended to be used as the default popup for a minimal UI extension.

Execution steps
-------------------------
1.  **Set up the HTML structure**: The `popup.html` file establishes the structure of the extension's popup with following components:
    -   A `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration indicating the use of HTML5.
    -   An `<html>` tag, as the root element.
    -   A `<head>` section with:
        -   A `<title>` tag setting the page title to "hypotez".
        -   A `<style>` tag that contains basic CSS to set the `width` and `padding` of the `body` element.
    -   A `<body>` section that includes:
        -   A `<h1>` heading with the text "hypotez".
        -   A `<p>` paragraph that provides instructions to the user: "Click the extension icon to collect data from the current webpage."
2.  **Use it with a Chrome extension**: This HTML file is designed to be the default popup page for a Chrome extension, by including the path to the `popup.html` in extension manifest file.
3. **Add functionality**: Any interactive functionality will require a linked JavaScript file in the `<head>` section, which is not included in this code snippet.
