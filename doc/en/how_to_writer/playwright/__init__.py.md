How to use this code block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This `__init__.py` file, located in the `src.webdriver.playwright` module, acts as an initialization file. Its purpose is to make the `Playwrid` class directly accessible from the `src.webdriver.playwright` package. This means that instead of importing `Playwrid` as `from src.webdriver.playwright.playwrid import Playwrid`, you can use the simpler import statement: `from src.webdriver.playwright import Playwrid`.

Execution steps
-------------------------
1.  **Import the `Playwrid` class**: In other modules, import the `Playwrid` class directly from the `src.webdriver.playwright` package.
    - Example: `from src.webdriver.playwright import Playwrid`
2.  **Use the `Playwrid` class**: You can then create instances of and use the `Playwrid` class as if it were defined directly inside the `src.webdriver.playwright` directory.

Usage example
-------------------------
```python
import asyncio
from src.webdriver.playwright import Playwrid
from playwright.async_api import async_playwright
from types import SimpleNamespace


async def main():
    # Example 1: Initialize and start the Playwright crawler with default settings
    browser = Playwrid()
    await browser.start("https://www.example.com")
    print("Successfully navigated to the URL with default settings.")

    # Example 2: Get HTML content of the page
    html_content = browser.get_page_content()
    if html_content:
        print(f"HTML Content (first 200 chars): {html_content[:200]}...")
    else:
        print("Failed to get HTML content.")

    # Example 3: Get content of the h1 element using CSS selector
    element_content = await browser.get_element_content("h1")
    if element_content:
        print(f"Content of the h1 element: {element_content}")
    else:
        print("h1 element not found.")

    # Example 4: Get the value of the page's title using XPath
    xpath_value = await browser.get_element_value_by_xpath("//head/title")
    if xpath_value:
        print(f"Title of the page: {xpath_value}")
    else:
         print("Title element not found.")

    # Example 5: Click a button by css selector
    await browser.click_element("button")
    print("Clicked button.")

    # Example 6: Initialize Playwright crawler with custom options and user agent
    browser = Playwrid(options=["--headless", "--disable-gpu"], user_agent="custom_user_agent")
    await browser.start("https://www.example.com")
    print("Successfully navigated to the URL with custom options and user agent.")


    # Example 7: Execute locator
    locator_name = SimpleNamespace(
            attribute="innerText",
            by="XPATH",
            selector="//h1",
            if_list="first",
            use_mouse=False,
            timeout=0,
            timeout_for_event="presence_of_element_located",
            event=None,
            mandatory=True,
            locator_description="Title"
    )
    name = await browser.execute_locator(locator_name)
    print(f"Page title: {name}")


    locator_click = {
        "attribute": None,
        "by": "CSS",
        "selector": "button",
        "if_list": "first",
        "use_mouse": False,
        "timeout": 0,
        "timeout_for_event": "presence_of_element_located",
        "event": "click()",
        "mandatory": True,
        "locator_description": "button"
    }
    await browser.execute_locator(locator_click)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```
```
