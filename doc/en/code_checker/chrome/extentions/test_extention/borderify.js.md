    Code Analysis for Module `src.webdriver.chrome.extentions.openai`

**Code Quality**
1
 - Strengths
        - The code applies a border style to the document body.
 - Weaknesses
    - The module is a JavaScript file, not a Python module, and therefore cannot be assessed against Python coding standards.
    - The code uses `alert` for debugging, which is not ideal for production use
    - The code lacks comments and docstrings.
    - The code is not configurable and hardcodes the styling
    - There is no error handling

**Improvement Recommendations**
1.  **Remove alert**: Remove the `alert` function, and replace with proper logging.
2.  **Add Docstrings**: Add detailed JSDoc comments to explain the code.
3.  **Externalize Styling**: Externalize the styling to a CSS file to have a more clean structure
4.  **Add Error Handling**: The code does not have any error handling. Add error handling to prevent unexpected behaviour.

**Optimized Code**
```javascript
/**
 * Sets a border style to the document body.
 * This is typically used for debugging purposes, to visually indicate that the extension is active
 */
try {
    // the code changes the border to red color
    document.body.style.border = "5px solid red";
    console.log("Border added to the body")
} catch (error) {
    // the code logs error if adding border failed
    console.error("Error while adding border to the body:", error)
}
```
**Changes**
```
- Removed the `alert` function.
- Added a JSDoc comment to describe the purpose of the code block.
- Added try catch block to handle potential errors.
- Added console log to trace code.
- Replaced inline style to style property
