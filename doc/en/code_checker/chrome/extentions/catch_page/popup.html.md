    Code Analysis for Module `src.webdriver.chrome.extentions.catch_page`

**Code Quality**
1
 - Strengths
        - The code provides a basic HTML structure for a popup window.
 - Weaknesses
    - The code is an HTML file, not a Python module, and therefore cannot be assessed against Python coding standards.
    - The code has a python style comment and the file has encoding which is not needed for html file.
    - The code has redundant docstrings

**Improvement Recommendations**
1.  **Remove Unnecessary Python Elements**: Remove the Python-style comment and encoding declaration.
2.  **Add proper comments**: Add HTML-style comments in HTML.
3.  **Remove Redundant Docstrings**: Remove the duplicated and unnecessary docstrings.
4. **Add Docstrings**: Add the module description as html comments
