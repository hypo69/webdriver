    Code Analysis for Module `src.webdriver.chrome.extentions.openai`

**Code Quality**
6
 - Strengths
        - The code provides a basic HTML structure for a popup window that uses AngularJS for dynamic content.
        - Includes basic elements for user interaction.
        - Uses a modular structure with separate JavaScript and CSS files.
 - Weaknesses
    - The code is an HTML file, not a Python module, and therefore cannot be assessed against Python coding standards.
    - The module has a python style comment which is not needed for an HTML file
    - The module includes a lot of hardcoded HTML content.
    - The code lacks detailed comments and docstrings.
    - The HTML structure could be improved for better accessibility and maintainability.
    - The structure of HTML elements is not clear, it would be better to use explicit tags for better understanding.

**Improvement Recommendations**
1.  **Remove Unnecessary Python Elements**: Remove the Python-style comment and encoding declaration.
2.  **Add Detailed Comments**: Add HTML-style comments to describe different parts of the code.
3.  **Improve Accessibility**: Use semantic HTML elements to improve accessibility.
4.  **Use CSS classes instead of inline style**: Use CSS classes for all styling instead of inline styles.
5. **Add Docstrings**: Add HTML comments to describe the purpose of the module.

**Optimized Code**
