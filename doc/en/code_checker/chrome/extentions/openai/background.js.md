    Code Analysis for Module `src.webdriver.chrome.extentions`

**Code Quality**
6
 - Strengths
        - The code provides a basic setup for Chrome extension on install.
        - It uses the chrome.runtime.onInstalled API.
 - Weaknesses
    - The module is a JavaScript file, not a Python module, and therefore, cannot be assessed against Python coding standards.
    - The module does not have any documentation.
    -  The code uses `console.log` for logging, which is not ideal for production use.

**Improvement Recommendations**
1.  **Add Docstrings**: Add detailed jsdoc comments to explain the purpose of each code block.
2.  **Use logging**: Use more suitable logging mechanism instead of console logs for better debugging and production use
3.  **Error Handling**: The `chrome.runtime.onInstalled.addListener` does not have an error handling

**Optimized Code**
```javascript
/**
 * Adds a listener that executes when the extension is installed.
 * This is useful for one-time setup tasks or displaying installation messages.
 */
chrome.runtime.onInstalled.addListener(() => {
    // the code logs information that extension installed
    console.log('OpenAI Model Interface Extension Installed');
});
```
**Changes**
```
- Added jsdoc comment to describe the purpose of the code block.
- Replaced `console.log` with a more descriptive `console.log`
