**Code Quality**
4
 - Strengths
        - The code provides a basic HTML structure for a popup window.
        - It includes meta tags for character set and viewport.
        - The code is provided in Russian.
 - Weaknesses
    - The module is an HTML file, not a Python module, and therefore cannot be assessed against Python coding standards.
    - The code has a python style comment which is not needed for an HTML file.
    - The code lacks detailed comments and docstrings.
     -  There are hardcoded values in HTML

**Improvement Recommendations**
1.  **Remove Unnecessary Python Elements**: Remove the Python-style comment and encoding declaration.
2.  **Add Detailed Comments**: Add HTML-style comments to describe different parts of the code and their purpose.
3. **Add Docstrings**: Add the module description as a HTML comment.
