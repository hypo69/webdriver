    Code Analysis for Module `src.webdriver.firefox`

**Code Quality**
10
 - Strengths
        - This is a simple `__init__.py` file that correctly imports the `Firefox` class from the `firefox` module.
        - The module is well-documented with a basic RST docstring.
        - There is nothing to improve.
 - Weaknesses
    - There are no specific weaknesses because the file is extremely simple and serves its purpose.

**Improvement Recommendations**
1.  **No code changes required**: The file is already well-structured and does not require any changes.

**Optimized Code**
```python
"""
.. module:: src.webdriver.firefox
    :platform: Windows, Unix
    :synopsis: Module initialization for the custom Firefox WebDriver.

This module initializes the custom Firefox WebDriver by importing the `Firefox` class.
"""

from .firefox import Firefox
```
**Changes**
