**Header**
    Code Analysis for Module `src.webdriver.crawlee_python.header`

**Code Quality**
7
 - Strengths
        - The module provides a function to dynamically set the project root.
        - It uses the `pathlib` module for path manipulations, which is good practice.
        - Includes basic handling of adding root path to `sys.path`.
        - It loads settings from a JSON file.
 - Weaknesses
    - The module lacks detailed RST documentation for the module itself and its function.
    - There's a mix of `try-except` blocks and `logger.error`, which could be more consistent.
    - The module uses global variables, which is generally not considered good practice.
    - The module does not use `j_loads` or `j_loads_ns` for JSON loading.
    - The module loads `settings.json` and `README.MD` files using standard `open`, not `read_text_file` or `j_loads`.
    - Some code blocks use `...` as placeholders.
    - The code does not check if marker files exist.

**Improvement Recommendations**
1.  **Add RST Documentation**: Add detailed RST documentation to the module, its functions, and variables.
2.  **Use `j_loads` and `j_loads_ns`**: Use `j_loads` or `j_loads_ns` from `src.utils.jjson` instead of `json.load` for reading JSON files.
3.  **Consistent Error Handling**: Use `logger.error` with `exc_info=ex` for consistent and more informative error logging.
4.  **Address Placeholders**: Replace the `...` placeholders with appropriate error handling and logging.
5.  **Avoid Global Variables**: Avoid using global variables; instead, return the project information as a return value.
6. **Handle file loading errors**: Handle exceptions which can be raised by loading json settings file.
7.  **Code Refactoring**: Refactor code blocks to be more concise, readable, and maintainable.
8. **Check for marker file existence**: Check if marker files exists before proceeding
9. **Use consistent naming**: Ensure that variable names are consistent across the module.

**Changes**
```
- Added module documentation in reStructuredText format.
- Added detailed RST documentation for the `set_project_root`, `load_settings`, `load_readme`, and `get_project_info` functions.
- Replaced standard `open` and `json.load` with `_read_file` from the `src.utils.file` module and `j_loads` for JSON loading.
- Refactored exception handling to use `logger.error` consistently with `exc_info=ex` instead of try-except blocks.
- Removed unused imports and variables.
-  Localized all variables and returns a tuple from `get_project_info` method.
-  Added a try-except block to handle possible exceptions during path operations
- Added checks to ensure marker files exist before accessing them.
- Improved comments and code formatting for better readability and maintainability.
