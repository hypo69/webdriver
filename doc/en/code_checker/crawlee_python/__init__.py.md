    Code Analysis for Module `src.webdriver.crawlee_python`

**Code Quality**
10
 - Strengths
        - This is a simple `__init__.py` file that correctly imports the `CrawleePython` class from the `crawlee_python` module.
        - The module is well-documented with a basic RST docstring.
        - There is nothing to improve.
 - Weaknesses
    - There are no specific weaknesses because the file is extremely simple and serves its purpose.

**Improvement Recommendations**
1.  **No code changes required**: The file is already well-structured and does not require any changes.

**Optimized Code**
