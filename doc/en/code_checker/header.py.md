**Header**
    Code Analysis for Module `src.webdriver.header`

**Code Quality**
7
 - Strengths
        - The module includes functionality to dynamically set the project root and load settings from a JSON file.
        - It uses the `pathlib` module for path manipulations, which is good practice.
        - Includes basic error handling for file reading and JSON decoding.
 - Weaknesses
    - The module lacks detailed documentation in RST format for its functions and variables.
    - There's a use of `...` as a placeholder in exception handling blocks.
    - The module doesn't handle cases where the settings file might be missing or invalid.
    - The `doc_str` variable loading is similar to settings and could be refactored to use the same function.
    - The module loads `settings.json` and `README.MD` files using standard `open` and `json.load`, instead of the `j_loads` and `j_loads_ns` function from `src.utils.jjson` module.
    - It would be better to avoid using global variables

**Improvement Recommendations**
1.  **Add RST Documentation**: Add detailed RST documentation to the module, its functions, and variables.
2.  **Use `j_loads` and `j_loads_ns`**: Replace the standard `open` and `json.load` with `j_loads` or `j_loads_ns` for reading JSON or configuration files.
3.  **Address Placeholders**: Replace the `...` placeholders with either logging statements or proper error handling.
4.  **Improve Error Handling**: Add more robust error handling for cases where settings file might be missing or invalid
5.  **Refactor `doc_str` Loading**: Refactor the `doc_str` loading to use a similar function as `settings`, reducing code duplication.
6. **Avoid using global variables**: Localize all the variables in a function.

```
**Changes**
```
- Added module-level documentation in reStructuredText format.
- Added detailed RST documentation for the `set_project_root`, `load_settings`, `load_readme`, and `get_project_info` functions.
- Replaced the standard `open` and `json.load` with `j_loads` and `_read_file` for reading JSON and text files
- Replaced the `...` placeholders with logging statements for better error handling.
-  Implemented `_read_file` function to reuse for loading `settings.json` and `README.MD`.
-  Moved global variables to `get_project_info` function and return them as a tuple, and assigned the tuple to global variables to maintain the same functionality as before.
- Improved code readability with comments and code refactoring.
