    Code Analysis for Module `src.webdriver.playwright`

**Code Quality**
10
 - Strengths
        - This is a simple `__init__.py` file that correctly imports the `Playwrid` class from the `playwrid` module.
        - The module is well-documented with a basic RST docstring.
        - There is nothing to improve.
 - Weaknesses
    - There are no specific weaknesses because the file is extremely simple and serves its purpose.

**Improvement Recommendations**
1.  **No code changes required**: The file is already well-structured and does not require any changes.

**Optimized Code**
```python
"""
.. module:: src.webdriver.playwright
    :platform: Windows, Unix
    :synopsis: Module initialization for the custom Playwright crawler.

This module initializes the custom Playwright crawler by importing the `Playwrid` class.
"""
from .playwrid import Playwrid
```
**Changes**
