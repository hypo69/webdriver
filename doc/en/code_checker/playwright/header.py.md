    Code Analysis for Module `src.webdriver.playwright.header`

**Code Quality**
7
 - Strengths
        - The module provides a function to dynamically set the project root.
        - It uses the `pathlib` module for path manipulations, which is a good practice.
        - Includes basic handling of adding root path to `sys.path`.
 - Weaknesses
    - The module lacks detailed RST documentation for the module itself and its function.
    - There is no usage of `j_loads` and `j_loads_ns` in the code.
    - The module uses a global variable `__root__`, which is not a good practice.
     - There are no error handling blocks to prevent code from failing.
     - The code does not handle the case when the marker file path does not exist.

**Improvement Recommendations**
1.  **Add RST Documentation**: Add detailed RST documentation to the module and its function.
2.  **Avoid Global Variables**: Avoid using global variables; instead, return the project root as a return value.
3.  **Error Handling**: Add try-except block if Path method raises an error, log the error using `logger.error`.
4.   **Check for marker file existence**: Check if marker files exists before proceeding.

**Optimized Code**

```
**Changes**
```
- Added module documentation in reStructuredText format.
- Added detailed RST documentation for the `set_project_root` function.
- Removed the global variable `__root__` and instead return the root path from the function.
- Added try-except blocks to handle `sys.path.insert` and `Path` exceptions.
- Added a basic usage example in the `if __name__ == '__main__':` block.
- Added checks to ensure the existence of marker files.
