    Code Analysis for Module `src.webdriver.edge.extentions.test_extention.html`

**Code Quality**
1
 - Strengths
        - The code provides a basic HTML structure for a popup window.
        - It includes inline CSS styles for basic styling.
 - Weaknesses
    - The code is an HTML file, not a Python module, and therefore cannot be assessed against Python coding standards.
    - The code has a python style comment and the file has encoding which is not needed for an html file.
    - The code has redundant docstrings
    - The code uses inline styles instead of external CSS.
    - There is no clear explanation of the HTML structure or elements used

**Improvement Recommendations**
1.  **Remove Unnecessary Python Elements**: Remove the Python-style comment and encoding declaration.
2.   **Add Detailed Comments**: Add HTML-style comments to describe different parts of the code and their purpose.
3.  **Use External CSS**: Move the CSS code to an external CSS file.
4.  **Add Docstrings**: Add the module description as HTML comment.
