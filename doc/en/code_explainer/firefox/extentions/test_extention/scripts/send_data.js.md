### Workflow of the JavaScript Code

This JavaScript code is designed to be injected into a web page. It collects data from the page (title, URL, and HTML content), and sends it to a specified server using a POST request.

1.  **Page Load Event Listener**:
    *   The script sets up a listener for the `load` event on the `window` object using `window.addEventListener('load', onPageLoad);`.
    *   **Example**: When the page is fully loaded and the event is fired.
    *   When the page is loaded, the `onPageLoad` function is executed.

2.  **Collecting Page Information (`onPageLoad` function)**:
    *   The `onPageLoad` function gathers the following information about the page:
        *   Extracts the page title using `document.title` and stores it in `title`.
        *   Gets the current URL using `window.location.href` and stores it in the `url` variable.
        *   Retrieves HTML content of the page from `document.body.innerHTML` and saves it to variable named `body`.
    *   It then creates a data object with keys `title`, `url`, and `body`.
    *   **Data flow**: The code gathers the page data and saves it to the data object.

3.  **Sending Data to Server**:
    *  The script sends POST request to the specified server endpoint (`'http://127.0.0.1/hypotez.online/api/'`) using `fetch()`.
    *  **Example**: After page is loaded, the POST request is made using the defined server url, payload and headers.
    *   It sets the `Content-Type` header to `application/json`.
    *   It stringifies the collected data using `JSON.stringify()` and sends it as the body of the request.
    *   If response status code is successful the data is parsed as json using `response.json()` and the result is logged using `console.log()`.
    *    If there is any error during fetching the data or parsing it, it will be caught in the `.catch` block and the error will be logged to console using `console.error()`.
    *    **Data flow**:  Page data is packaged into JSON format and sent to the server with POST request. The server's response (if any) is logged to the console.

### Dependencies Analysis:

1.  **`window`**:  Used to add event listener to the `load` event and to access `window.location.href`.
2.  **`document`**: Used to access the HTML document object model, specifically used to access `document.title`, and `document.body.innerHTML` properties.
3.  **`fetch` API**: Used for making HTTP POST requests to a server.
4.  **`JSON.stringify`**: Used to serialize JavaScript objects into a JSON string, before sending it to the server.
5.  **`console`**: Used to log messages to the console, with `console.log` and `console.error` methods.

### Detailed Explanation

**Imports:**

*   This script does not have any import statements, as it is a standalone JavaScript file that uses browser API.

**Classes:**

*   This script does not define any classes.

**Functions:**

*   **`onPageLoad()`**:
    *   **Arguments**: None.
    *   **Purpose**: Called when page is loaded, and gets data from the page and sends it to the server with `fetch` method.
    *   **Return**: None.

**Variables:**

*  `title` (`str`): Stores the title of the HTML document.
*   `url` (`str`): Stores the URL of the loaded document.
*   `body` (`str`): Stores the `innerHTML` of document's body element.
*   `data` (`object`): Stores an object containing collected page data (`title`, `url`, `body`), ready to be converted to json.
*   `serverUrl` (`str`): Stores a hardcoded server URL to send data to using fetch API.
*   `response` (`Response`): Stores the response from the fetch request.
*  `json` (`object`): Stores json data that is parsed from response.
* `error` (`object`): Stores an error object that was caught in catch block.

**Potential Errors and Areas for Improvement:**

*   **Hardcoded URL**: The server URL is hardcoded (`'http://127.0.0.1/hypotez.online/api/'`) and should be configurable.
*   **No Data Validation**: There are no checks or validation of collected data before sending to the server.
*   **Basic Logging**: Logging is very basic by only using  `console.log()` and `console.error()` method and could be improved by using a custom logging service.
*   **Basic Error Handling**: Error handling in the script is basic, and can be improved by adding more specific error handling, for each step and different status codes.
*   **No Response Handling**: The script does not handle the response body and only logs the response status and json response, but does not provide a way to handle specific values from the response.

**Relationship Chain with Other Parts of Project:**

*   This module is intended to be injected into a web page, and it has no direct dependencies with any other part of the project, except the backend server that receives the POST request.
*  It uses browser's API to retrieve data from web page and javascript's `fetch` method to send POST request to the server.
