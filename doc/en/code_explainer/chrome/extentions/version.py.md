### Workflow of the `version.py` Module

This `version.py` module defines several variables, which are commonly used in Python packages to store meta information like version, name, documentation, and author.

1.  **Module Name**:
    *   The variable `__name__` is defined to store the name of the module as a string.
    *   **Example**: `__name__:str`
    *   It is an annotation and not an assignment, so the actual value would be set by python to `__main__` if the script was launched directly, or the module name when imported.

2.  **Module Version**:
    *   The variable `__version__` is defined to store the version of the module.
    *   **Example**: `__version__="3.12.0.0.0.4"`
    *   It is set to a string value which represents the current module version.

3.  **Module Documentation**:
    *   The variable `__doc__` is defined to store module documentation.
    *   **Example**: `__doc__:str`
    *    It's an annotation, but it's assigned with a docstring in a rst format which will be ignored by python interpreter.

4.  **Module Details**:
    *    The variable `__details__` is defined to store additional details about the module.
    *   **Example**: `__details__:str="Details about version for module or class"`
    *  It is set to a string which provides a description of module's version.

5. **Annotations**:
    *  The variable `__annotations__` is defined to store type annotations for variables and functions in the module.
    * **Example**: `__annotations__`
    *  It's an annotation, but no value is assigned, and it's not used in the code.

6.  **Module Author**:
    *   The variable `__author__` is defined to store the author of the module.
    *   **Example**: `__author__='hypotez '`
    *   It's set to string with the author name.

### Dependencies Analysis:

This module does not have any dependencies, as it only defines variables, and imports no modules.

## <explanation>

### Detailed Explanation

**Imports:**

*   There are no import statements in this module.

**Classes:**

*   This module does not define any classes.

**Functions:**

*   This module does not define any functions.

**Variables:**

*   `__name__` (`str`): Stores the name of the module, if the script was launched as main module - python will set it to `__main__`.
*   `__version__` (`str`): Stores the version of the module or package as a string.
*   `__doc__` (`str`): Stores the docstring of the module.
*   `__details__` (`str`): Stores additional details about the module.
*   `__annotations__`: Stores type annotations, but it's not used directly, and only annotated.
*   `__author__` (`str`):  Stores the name of the author as a string.

**Potential Errors and Areas for Improvement:**

*   **Type Hinting**:  Type hinting is used only for annotations, there is no default value assignment for the variables.
*   **Unused Variable**: Variable `__annotations__` is not used in code and has no assignment.
*    **Inconsistent Docstring**: Docstrings are inconsistent and hard to read.
*   **Hardcoded values**:  The version and author are hardcoded and it might be better to load them from the configuration or settings file.

**Relationship Chain with Other Parts of Project:**

*   This module is a part of the `src.webdriver.chrome.extentions` package.
*   It does not interact with other parts of the project directly, but provides metadata which can be used in other modules to identify the version, author, etc. of this module.
