### Workflow of the `popup.html` File

This HTML file defines a simple popup for a Chrome extension named "hypotez." It displays a basic message to the user, instructing them to interact with the extension.

1.  **HTML Structure**:
    *   The file starts with the `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration, indicating that it's an HTML5 document.
    *   It contains an `<html>` tag as the root element of the page.
    *   The `<head>` section contains meta-information:
        *   It sets the title of the page to `"hypotez"` with the `<title>` tag.
        *   It includes inline CSS styles within the `<style>` tag to set the width and padding for the body element.
    *  The `<body>` tag contains visible content:
        *   It has a heading (`<h1>`) with the text "hypotez".
        *   It contains a paragraph (`<p>`) with instructions for the user.
