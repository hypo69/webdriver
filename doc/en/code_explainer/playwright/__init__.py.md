### Workflow of the `__init__.py` Module

This `__init__.py` file serves as the entry point for the `src.webdriver.playwright` package, making the `Playwrid` class available for import.

1.  **Import Statement**:
    *   The module imports the `Playwrid` class from the `src.webdriver.playwright.playwrid` module.
    *   **Example**: `from .playwrid import Playwrid`
    *   This allows importing the `Playwrid` class using `from src.webdriver.playwright import Playwrid`.
